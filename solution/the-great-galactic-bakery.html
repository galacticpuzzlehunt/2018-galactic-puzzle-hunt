<p>After teams successfully solve all three cookie metas (Chessmen, Fortune Cookies, and Animal Crackers), they unlock this puzzle, the final puzzle of the 2018 Galactic Puzzle Hunt. Unlike every other puzzle in this hunt, this puzzle has no word/short phrase answer (and is in fact missing the standard answer submission box). Rather, this final puzzle can be thought of as a metameta and a final &ldquo;clickaround&rdquo;, where you must use the knowledge and abilities you have gained throughout the hunt to finally defeat the Cookie Monster.</p>

<p>This puzzle can be divided into two parts: 1. finding the Cookie Monster (the metameta), and 2. bringing him down to zero cookies (the clickaround). After bringing the Cookie Monster down to 0 cookies, teams were redirected to a page with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StBK8Hedkjg">this video</a> and officially finished the hunt!</p>

<h3>Part 1 - Finding the Cookie Monster</h3>

<p>When teams registered for the hunt, they were asked to provide answers for three &ldquo;security questions&rdquo; in the event that they forgot their password. These three questions were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is your favorite compound word?</li>
  <li>What is buried in your backyard?</li>
  <li>What is the first name of your favorite actor?</li>
</ul>

<p>The first time a new user visits our site (after the hunt started), they were greeted with a dialog box at the bottom informing them that &ldquo;This website uses cookies to enhance your puzzle-solving experience.&rdquo; If teams inspect their list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">web cookies</a> associated with galacticpuzzlehunt.com, they’ll find one with the name <span class="fixed">cookie</span> and with the value <span class="fixed">&lt;username&gt;_&lt;answer1&gt;_&lt;answer2&gt;_&lt;answer3&gt;</span>, with their own username and answers to their own security questions.</p>

<p>The text of this puzzle strongly hints towards the security questions (&ldquo;security&rdquo;, &ldquo;questionable&rdquo;), as well as examining your web cookies (&ldquo;inspector&rdquo;, &ldquo;browsing&rdquo;, &ldquo;stores of cookies&rdquo;). Eventually, we must realize that to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the Cookie Monster, we must break into his account by changing our &ldquo;security cookie&rdquo; to his.</p>

<p>To do this, we must know his username and his answers to the three security questions. We learned that the username is <span class="fixed">mewantcookie</span> from the Consolation Prize meta. (The screenshot on the Story page shows his username in the top-right corner). Getting the answers to the security questions is harder.</p>

<p>In the puzzle, the phrase &ldquo;that’s good enough for me&rdquo; is italicized. This phrase is a prominent lyric in the popular song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8mB6VsUHw">&ldquo;C is for Cookie&rdquo;</a>, sung by the Cookie Monster himself.</p>

<p>Also, the answers to our three metas are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ANDROID</li>
  <li>BEST-SELLING CRIME NOVEL</li>
  <li>CALL SIGN</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of the phrase &ldquo;C is for Cookie&rdquo; and the fact that our three meta answers start with &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; should eventually lead us to the final insight: each of our meta answers can be associated with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abecedarius">abecedarian</a> list—that is, a list where each item begins with a different letter of the alphabet in order.</p>
<p>Specifically: ANDROID refers to the Android operating system, in which each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history">new version</a> takes the name of a different alphabetical dessert. BEST-SELLING CRIME NOVEL refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Millhone">The Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mysteries</a> by Sue Grafton, in which each book starts with a different letter (&ldquo;A&rdquo; is for Alibi, &ldquo;B&rdquo; is for Burglar). Finally, CALL SIGN refers to the NATO phonetic alphabet in which each letter is assigned to a different code word.</p>
<p>Since we are thinking about &ldquo;C is for Cookie,&rdquo; we should take the corresponding words in the list that begin with C. These are (in order) CUPCAKE, CORPSE, and CHARLIE. (Incidentally, these words all end with E as in COOKIE.) Happily, these three words are very good answers for our three security questions (cupcake is a compound word, a corpse is something that could be buried in your backyard (although if so, we have some concerns…), and Charlie is the first name of several actors).</p>
<p>If we try to reset Cookie Monster’s account using his username and the answers to the three security questions, we’ll get the message that a password reset link was sent to his email (which we don’t know). However, we’ll also get an additional hint which states &ldquo;Meanwhile, take a careful look at all the cookies you’ve gathered so far on this website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we change our cookie to <span class="fixed">mewantcookie_cupcake_corpse_charlie</span>, and then refresh the page, we’ll discover that we’re now impersonating Cookie Monster! Crucially, we now have access to the final tool: the Great Galactic Oven, which also enables us to use all three other tools. Amusingly, this &ldquo;account&rdquo; has solved all the puzzles with the answer &ldquo;COOKIE,&rdquo; so it cannot ask for hints or submit any new answers.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, this is not how session or login cookies actually work. Each team has its own instance of Cookie Monster’s &ldquo;account&rdquo; which are independent and do not interact each other.</p>

<h3>Part 2 - Bringing down the Cookie Monster</h3>

<p>For this part, teams were presented with four piles of cookies, with 314,159,265, 358,979,323, 846,264,338, and 327,950,288 cookies respectively. Teams were requested to reduce all four piles to zero cookies using four operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Android: Select two (not necessarily distinct) piles. Add the number of cookies of the first type to the number of cookies of the second type.</li>
  <li>Best-selling Crime Novel: Select a pile. Steal half the cookies (rounded down) from the cookie type with the most cookies and give them to  that pile.</li>
  <li>Call Sign: For each type of cookies, if the number of cookies of that type is equal to the phonespell of some sequence of digits x, then replace the number of cookies in the pile with x. E.G., a pile with 896 = TWO cookies becomes a pile with two cookies after this operation, and a pile with 6639376749 = ONEZEROSIX cookies becomes a pile with 106 cookies after this operation.</li>
  <li>Normal clicking still works, and adds 1 cookie to the pile as usual</li>
</ul>

<p>The numbers start with 9 digits (incidentally the digits of pi), and there is only one operation that can reduce the number of cookies (Call Sign). However, even very large numbers get reduced to very small numbers by Call Sign, and it is not too hard to reach 9376 (ZERO in phone spell) from numbers below 9376 in order to finish the puzzle. Hence, the puzzle can be thought of as being about how to efficiently reach Call Sign numbers with every pile.</p>

<p>Teams solved this puzzle in many different ways. First, here are some general ideas that various teams found useful in their solutions:</p>

<h4>Equalizing trick</h4>
<p>By repeatedly using the Best-selling Crime Novel operation on all piles, they converge to values of n, n, n, 2n. This can be useful in some solutions, as it means that if you want to get a pile to some specific value, you can do that by getting the total sum to 5 times that value (and it can be easier to work with the total sum than with the specific number in a pile).</p>

<h4>Binary trick</h4>
<p>Starting from 1 cookie of a type, it is possible to efficiently reach any number by doubling and adding 1. Using the binary representation of the number, reading from the left (excluding the first 1), double and add 1 for each &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and just double for each &ldquo;0&rdquo; to reach any number using the Android and click operations. For example, the binary representation of 1000 is 1111101000, so we can reach 1000 from 1 by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Doubling and adding 1 (1&rarr;3)</li>
  <li>Doubling and adding 1 (3&rarr;7)</li>
  <li>Doubling and adding 1 (7&rarr;15)</li>
  <li>Doubling and adding 1 (15&rarr;31)</li>
  <li>Doubling (31&rarr;62)</li>
  <li>Doubling and adding 1 (62&rarr;125)</li>
  <li>Doubling (125&rarr;250)</li>
  <li>Doubling (250&rarr;500)</li>
  <li>Doubling (500&rarr;1000)</li>
</ol>

<p>This process is &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; in the sense that we can reach very large numbers with very few clicks (for example, we can reach any number less than 1 trillion in less than 80 operations).</p>

<p>Teams do not start with any piles containing just one cookie, but variants of this idea can still be used. For instance, starting with two piles of n cookies (obtained by the above &ldquo;equalizing trick&rdquo; for instance), this method can be used to efficiently get any multiple of n cookies. Alternatively, it can be used to precisely control the number of cookies modulo some number.</p>

<p>At the ending step, this method can also be used to quickly reach 9376 from a small number.</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Staggered Piles&rdquo; trick</h4>
<p>Many teams noticed that after the first steps of their puzzle, they could make piles with eg. 1000 and 1000000 cookies, and then adjust the remaining piles efficiently using the Android operation and these piles. This is useful, as it reduces the most difficult part of the puzzle to making just one or two piles small.</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Intended&rdquo; Solution</h4>
<p>It’s clear that most numbers are not phone spell numbers, so it is difficult to randomly get close enough to a large phone spell number to reach it by clicking the cookie in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>With this in mind, one way to approach the puzzle is to think about how to efficiently reach an arbitrary large number, and then apply this method to a number chosen to be reducible by Call Sign. This solution takes this approach, and reaches zero cookies in around 250 actions and 500 clicks.</p>

<p>This solution uses the &ldquo;equalizing trick&rdquo;: applying BESTSELLINGCRIMENOVEL repeatedly causes the pile values to converge to values of x, x, x, 2x without changing the total sum of cookies in the piles. In this case, our target value for x is 64638473373836749. This is the phonespell of NINETHREESEVENSIX, so under two applications of CALLSIGN this becomes 9376, then 0. Our total target value is 5x, or 323192366869183745.</p>

<p>To efficiently hit a large target number, we can use the &ldquo;binary trick&rdquo;: a number whose binary representation is k digits can be constructed in less than 2*k steps by the operations &ldquo;increment by 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;multiply by 2&rdquo;. The method for that is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start from the left side (most significant bit)</li>
<li>If it’s a 1, increment by 1</li>
<li>If we’re not already at the rightmost digit, then multiply by 2 and look at the next digit</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, we will actually use 3 operations: &ldquo;increment by 1&rdquo; by clicking the target pile, &ldquo;multiply by 2&rdquo; by using ANDROID with the target pile twice, and &ldquo;add value of first pile&rdquo; by using ANDROID on the first pile and the target pile.</p>

<p>Our initial piles are 314159265, 358979323, 846264338, 327950288. We are going to transform the third pile into 323192365868094869 in order to hit the desired total. Doing some math (Wolfram Alpha is very helpful here):</p>

<ol>
<li>846264338 can be doubled at most 28 times before becoming larger than 323192365868094869</li>
<li>323192365868094869 - 846264338 * 2^28 = 96025012400526741</li>
<li>96025012400526741 = 314159265 * 305657108 + 9221121</li>
<li><span class="fixed">10010001101111111010100010100</span> is the binary form of 305657108 (quotient)</li>
<li><span class="fixed">00000100011001011010000000001</span> is the binary form of 9221121 (remainder, with leading 0’s)</li>
</ol>

<p>The binary representations now give us instructions to hit our goal. We will double the third pile 28 times. In between each doubling, either add 1, add 314159265, both, or neither. Denoting adding the first pile as F, incrementing as I, and doubling as D, the steps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>F</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DI</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>DI</li>
<li>DFI</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>DFI</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>DFI</li>
<li>DFI</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DFI</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DF</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>DI</li>
</ul>

<p>This will allow us to double 846264338 to 846264338*2^28 while adding 96025012400526741 at the same time. Now our piles have values 314159265, 358979323, 323192365868094869, 327950288. The next step is (mind-numbingly) applying BESTSELLINGCRIMENOVEL, until the piles are 64638473373836749, 64638473373836749, 64638473373836749, 129276946747673498.</p>

<p>Finally, we get to use CALLSIGN. Activating it twice turns the first three piles to 0. Then use BESTSELLINGCRIMENOVEL again to split the 129276946747673498 pile into two piles of 64638473373836749. Another two uses of CALLSIGN brings us all four piles having 0 cookies, as desired.</p>

<p>Action/Click Count:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Grow third pile to reach target total: 51 actions 137 clicks</li>
  <li>Equalize to x, x, x, 2x: ~200 actions, ~400 clicks (I always lose track counting here since it’s so monotonous)</li>
  <li>Zero out the piles: 5 actions, 6 clicks</li>
</ol>

<p>Total: ~256 actions, ~543 clicks</p>

<p>One nice property of this and other variations of the &ldquo;intended&rdquo; solution is that they can be constructed intuitively without the need for a computer or coding (although doing long division or base conversion manually is somewhat of a chore, it’s not unreasonable the way something like breadth-first search by hand would be).</p>

<h4>Incremental Solution</h4>

<p>The initial starting values were the digits of pi and the phonespell numbers were fairly arbitrary. The &ldquo;Intended&rdquo; solution and variants thereof work for all initial and target values, but our initial and target values allowed for some alternative solutions that are perhaps less general, and indeed, the vast majority of teams used some variation on this solution. These generally followed the below outline.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use best-selling crime novel multiple times (with possible usage of android) to make one number close to a call-sign-able number (within 5000 is good enough), then click away and then call-sign to make that number small (two/three digits).</li>
  <li>Repeat with the three remaining numbers. For the later steps the gap can be made much larger since we can android/click the small number up to a four-digit number (like 9376) and use that to do much of the clicking work.</li>
  <li>When we have two or more small numbers we can make this even faster by having one number at around 1000000 (that is easily call-sign-able, like 896896) and one around 1000. Once all numbers are made small, we can just bump all numbers up to 9376 and call-sign them all to zero.)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Incremental Solution Example</h4>

<p><i>Explicit 6-step algorithms for step 1 and 2 provided by K-CLICK</i></p>

<p>Let A(x,y) be the Android operation between x and y, B(x) be Bestselling Crime Novel applied to x and CS(x) apply callsign to x. The piles will be abbreviated CC (chocolate chip), CM (chessmen), FC (fortune cookie), AC (animal crackers).</p>

<p>While playing around, teams noticed that they could get the first few digits to match one of the 10 call signable numbers. In particular, teams were often able to get to &ldquo;THREENINE&rdquo; or 847,336,463. Some teams found this by clicking around since the path to something close to it was only 6 clicks away, or maybe by writing a program and limiting the search space. This sequence of operations was B(AC), B(CM), A(CC, CM), B(AC), B(CM), B(AC). This leaves 847,335,976 cookies left on the animal cracker. Incrementing only 513 times, we can use CS(AC) to get 39.</p>

<p>At this point, a team could follow any other solution that uses a small pile. Teams may also notice that they could double FC from 423,132,169 to 846,264,169 which is pretty close to THREENINE again. Before we double, we can increase 39 to a larger value, like 2000. This lets us apply A(AC, FC) a couple hundred times and also do only a couple hundred clicks. Once we have two piles, one at around 2000 and the other at 39, and we can use the staggered piles trick.</p>

<p>Alternatively, at least one team discovered that from the state right after CS(AC), one could do B(CC), B(CC), B(FC), A(CM, FC), B(CC), B(CM). This brings the counts to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>410,437,496</li>
  <li>646,334,869</li>
  <li>493,301,512</li>
  <li>39</li>
</ul>

<p>The second pile is really close to NINEEIGHT, but slightly over. However, we can instead go for NINETHREE, or 646,384,733 instead, since it is only a difference of 49864. This can be achieved by getting the 39 to something on the order of 1000 and then adding + clicking appropriately. This uses fewer clicks than the alternative, but there may be an even better way to get the second pile low.</p>

<p>In either case, we get a second pile down to a low number. The other two piles can be modified (e.g. by applying B) to be around 300M and 600M, and we can use the staggered piles trick to hit target numbers (e.g. EIGHTFIVE = 344,483,483 or NINEEIGHT = 646,334,448).</p>

<p>By now, all the piles are small, and so they can be incremented to 9376 and callsigned again.</p>

        <h5 class="solution-puzzle-subheader">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
        <p>The clickaround (Part 2) was actually implemented on Saturday, while the hunt was running, as we were short on time in the weeks leading up to the hunt and just didn&rsquo;t get around to it. As a result, we weren&rsquo;t able to add features like save states or an undo button, and we didn&rsquo;t add the &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; confirmation on the oven until after the first few teams finished, so we are really sorry that this ended up being way more stressful than intended.</p>
