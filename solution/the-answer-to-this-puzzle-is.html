Clues by Lewis Chen, Anderson Wang, Rahul Sridhar, Ben Yang, Jon Schneider, Colin Lu, and more

        </h5>
        

<p>Initially, the only text on the puzzle page informs us that &ldquo;[t]he answer to this puzzle is the country in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; There are four countries in the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. When we submit the answer ENGLAND, we&rsquo;re told that the answer is actually &ldquo;the non-radioactive element whose atomic weight is between 142 and 152.&rdquo; This clue has three different answers: neodymium, europium, and samarium. Submitting any of these answers leads to even more clues.</p>
<p>If we type in enough answers, we&rsquo;ll notice a few things: many (but not all) clues have multiple answers, and almost all of the answers begin with either N, S, E or W. These four letters correspond to the four compass points (north, south, east, and west). Using this, we can organize the clues into a grid, with the original United Kingdom clue at the center, and the four clues that appear when we submit Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales appearing to the north, east, south and west respectively.</p>

<img src="the-answer-to-this-puzzle-is/image2.png">

<p>Observe that each pair of adjacent cells in this grid is connected by a one-way arrow. Notably, five of the clues have unique answers that do not start with N, S, E, or W. Submitting any of these answers simply takes you back to the same vertex. Read from left to right, these answers are &ldquo;GOING BACK TOWARDS UNITED KINGDOM&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This phrase obliquely clues the final step. The majority of the arrows point away from the center of the grid.</p>
<p>If we highlight the arrows that point <i>towards</i> the center, we spell <b>HALT</b>, which is our final answer.</p>

        <h5 class="solution-puzzle-subheader">Author&rsquo;s Notes</h5>
        <p>This puzzle went through a lot of different design iterations and quite a few people helped with coming up with both ideas and clues. The clues are quite constrained because the answers must begin with N/S/E/W, especially when limiting yourself to only a few quantifiers, so it was truly a group effort to come up with all of them.</p><p>The initial idea was conceived by Brian (although the only recognizable vestiges remaining are the answer submission abuse idea, as well as questions with multiple answers). Then a group of us tried to brainstorm more interesting ways to extract from a graph, and the idea of taking edges with reversed directions for extraction was by Lewis. We experimented with various different grid layouts, but when the initial grid ended up being too difficult in testsolving, Anderson proposed the current grid with arrows pointing out from the center, which is much more symmetric. Even so, more testsolving indicated that we probably needed a cluephrase to help hint at extraction, so the cluephrase spelled out by the sinks was created by Rahul.</p><p>Some things were unfortunately a consequence of the grid layout. For instance, HALT has to be read top-down then left-right instead of the normal reading order, since the L cannot be in the bottom left corner. If it were, then the corner of the L would be an inaccessible source node, much like the center node is right now. We had to ensure that the grid contained only one such node.</p><p>Also, even the clues with only a single answer were worded ambiguously such that they could conceivably take on multiple answers.</p><p>Throughout the long process, we encountered many interesting stories and/or issues, including:</p><ul><li>The discovery that the four countries of United Kingdom start with N, S, E, W, respectively.</li><li>To a lesser extent, that we could relate the Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic forces via the Grand Unified Theory.</li><li>Initially, before we had a cluephrase, our sinks were literally questions that had no answer, such as &ldquo;...the winner of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction&rdquo;.</li><li>In a previous grid, one of our testsolvers had the correct idea of considering arrows pointing in different directions. However, instead of drawing out these edges on the picture, instead he interpreted them as Morse code. And lo and behold&hellip; they took on ONLY the letters N, E, W, and S. Moreover, drawing out the first sequence (EWWESS) resulted in drawing out a T, and while the second sequence was a bit less compelling (SSENNE), this coincidental and totally unintended red herring floored us!</li></ul><p>For even more statistics about this puzzle, <a href = "the-answer-to-this-puzzle-is/stats.pdf">check out this PDF</a>!</p>
